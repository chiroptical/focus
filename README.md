Environment variables and set up
----

You'll need to set the following environment variables to use focus.

```
export TWITCH_CLIENT_ID='...'
export TWITCH_SECRET='...'
export TWITCH_REDIRECT_URI='http://localhost:3000/oauth'
export TWITCH_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN='...'
export TWITCH_REFRESH_TOKEN='...'
export TWITCH_USER_ID='...'
```

You can get your client id and secret by registering an application at
`https://dev.twitch.tv/console`. Once those are set, you currently need to get
`twitch-cli` (https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/cli/). I get it from through my nix
shell.

```
twitch-cli configure -i $TWITCH_CLIENT_ID -s $TWITCH_SECRET # assuming you have already set these
twitch-cli token --user-token --scopes "user:read:chat user:write:chat moderator:read:followers channel:read:subscriptions"
```

The tool will open a webserver at port 3000 and run the oauth flow for you.
You will need to set your "OAuth Redirect URLs"  to `http://localhost:3000`
for this step to work. This will allow you to add your user access token and
refresh token. Once all of that is exported, you can run `rebar3 shell` and
`twitch:auth()` should get you your user id. If that doesn't work, you have
configured something incorrectly.
